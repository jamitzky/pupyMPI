(up to commit ????)
======================================

Changes from 0.6 are the use of epoll and poll
Changes from 0.7.0 is handling writelist only when outgoing requests exist

Changes from 0.7.1 are split handling of in and out sockets in select/poll functions and for in thread and out thread

Changes from 0.7.2 only trying accept on a read socket if it is the main receive socket


Changes from 0.7.3 are the use of tcp nodelay on sockets to ensure no batching which boosts our collective operations. Also some cruft has been cleaned for reduce and bcast operations
