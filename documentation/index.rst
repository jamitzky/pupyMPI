Getting started
-------------------------
There is a :ref:`getting started tutorial <getting-started>`. This should be very easy for people
already familliar with standard MPI. It should serve as a usefull introduction
to people with no experience with MPI. 

Reference manual
--------------------------
Take a look at our :ref:`reference manual <api>`. And keep it under your pillow. 

Running your program
-------------------------
Running your pupyMPI program is done through a
startup program called mpirun.py. We also have
some  :ref:`documentation for that <mpirun>`.

If you're from DIKU you might have to run your
prorams on the MiG. Luckily there are MiG
environments predefined and a 
:ref:`guide <diku-mig>` to use pupyMPI with MiG.
